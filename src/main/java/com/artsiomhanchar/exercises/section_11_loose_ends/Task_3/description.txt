3. Create a collection of at least five Person objects with first name & last name fields. Add a
few null objects to the collection in random places. Use an enhanced for-loop to iterate
over the collection and print out the first names of each person. Use Optional to prevent
NullPointerException and to print “Unknown” for the first names of null items.
1. Use the Optional API to display “Unknown” for null entries and entries whose first name
is shorter than 3 characters.
