Revise the chess modeling from Section 8, exercise 8 to throw an exception when a chess
piece tries to move to a square occupied by a friendly piece. Consider what is an
appropriate type of exception for this. No code solution provided

I’d create a custom subclass of
RuntimeException and throw it
on line 27 of ChessBoard instead
of just returning as it currently
does. I’d also pass into its
constructor, info about the
destination coordinates we
attempted to move to and maybe
even what piece is already there
so that that info could be
conveyed on the receiving end of
the exception
