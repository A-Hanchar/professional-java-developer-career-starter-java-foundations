         * Comment:
         * You’ll need to enable the
         * MULTILINE option on Java’s regex
         * engine. You can try building the
         * regex piece by piece using the
         * regex tester at https://
         * regex101.com. If you do use the
         * regex tester, be sure to enable it
         * for “java” and note that it does
         * NOT use double backspaces "\" as
         * are needed in the Java IDE.
