What might be a more memory-efficient collection to use to store millions or billions of
objects in the order in which they come, if you don’t know exactly how many objects you’ll
need to store before-hand?
8. How could you take your col

LinkedList.
1) need to retain the order in which they come, so you’ll need some type of List.
2) dealing with millions or billions. ArrayList would work BUT it pre-allocates large chunks of memory whenever it needs to make more space.
This can be inefficient and wasteful of memory temporarily. A linked list can grow dynamically very efficiently.
