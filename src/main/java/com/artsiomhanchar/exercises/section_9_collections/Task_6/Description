Same as exercise 5 but allow program to remove a model by passing the model name as
an argument to the main() method. For example, if you had been getting the following
output initially:
Car[make=Tesla, model=3, year=2016]
Car[make=Tesla, model=Roadster, year=2009]
Car[make=Tesla, model=S, year=2014]
Car[make=Tesla, model=X, year=2015]
Car[make=Tesla, model=Y, year=2017]
And then you modify the program as instructed and pass in “Roadster” as an argument and rerun, you’d get the following output:
Car[make=Tesla, model=3, year=2016]
Car[make=Tesla, model=S, year=2014]
Car[make=Tesla, model=X, year=2015]
Car[make=Tesla, model=Y, year=2017]
